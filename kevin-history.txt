The Heist family has a renowned lineage of military soldiers. Kevin,
destined to tred in his fathers footsteps, was trained in the lethal
military martial arts even before enlisting.

Once in the military he quickly rose in the ranks, showing excellent
leadership skills and tactical and strategic thinking. Even though
Kevin had a promising youth and a thorough training he did not fair
well on the battlefield. The attrocities of war were to much for him
and he sought refuge in an ancient forest.

It must be there that he acquinted and befriended a wholly remarkable
race: Dwellers of the Forest of Old. By gaining their trust and
defending the race against all kinds of peril Kevin was bestowed with
the greatest honor: Guardian of the Forest of Old.

The higly magical dwellers of the Forest of Old are a highly sought
after target for all kind of magical potions and spells. In one
horrendous attempt to harverst an entire family the Forest of Old was
set on fire. Fearing for the continued well-being of the Forest of Old
Kevin fled, bringing the Spirit Container of the Forest of Old, vowing
to once restore the mighty forest.
