Drax Plunkett was born in a  nameless village in a long forgotten
country. There was nothing peculiar about the boy besides that he was
very likable. It was not uncommon for him to be given things just
because he was so charming. Drax learned early on in his live how to
manipulate people.

While a visiting Psychologist of the church of the prosperous planets
traveled through Drax's town she witnessed the boys raw talent and
took him as an apprentice. Soon he surpassed his tutors and soon the
Church had a huge following. It was then that Drax's other talents
became apparent: that of running a prosperous business.

With growing influence of  the Church of the Prosperous Planets came
the influential people. High officials, legislators, even kings, all
wanted to known what their future had in store for them. Drax while in
rank was a lower disicple, often was granted the important task.

Because of this a king of a small country requested that Drax would
join his court for the occasionel counseling. In these years Drax
perfected his skills while gaining influence within the kingdom. Be
